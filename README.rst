Using django-uploadify
======================

How It Works
------------

Django-uploadify works by providing a template tag, {% multi_file_upload <upload_complete_url> %}., which takes a single parameter.  The template tag will render the Uploadify jquery/flash multi-file upload interface on the page.  A user may operate Uploadify, selecting and uploading multiple files.  For each file that is uploaded a Django signal will be fired, containing the file data.  After all uploads have been completed, the template tag will use the value of 'upload_complete_url'.  It will fetch that page via AJAX, and replace the Uploadify GUI with the contents of the page (a jQuery $.load).

Code Examples
-------------

To insert the django-uploadify template tag... ::
    
    {% load uploadify_tags %}{% multi_file_upload '/your/url/upload/complete/' %}

To add custom parameters to uploadify... ::
    
    {% multi_file_upload '/your/url/upload/complete/' unique_id=someobj.id auto=1 %}

Creating a signal receiver... ::

    def upload_received_handler(sender, request, data, **kwargs):
        if data:
            # process the received file here
            try:
                related_obj = SomeObj.objects.get(id=request.GET.get('unique_id'), owner=request.user)
            except SomeObj.DoesNotExist:
                return {'status': 'failed', 'status_msg': 'SomeObj not found'}
            Media = Media.objects.create(image=data)
            return {'status': 'ok', 'url': photo.get_preview_url()}
        raise Http404

    upload_recieved.connect(upload_received_handler, dispatch_uid='yourapp.whatever.upload_received')


Reference
=========

Client Side Event:  allUploadsComplete
--------------------------------------
On the client side, a javascript event is provided to capture when all uploads have been completed.  It can be bound with the following jQuery code: ::

    $('#uploadify').bind('allUploadsComplete', function(e, data){
         // This code executes on AllUploadsComplete event...
    }

upload_complete_url Parameter
-----------------------------
When this page is fetched by the client-side javascript, the following Uploadify values are POST'ed to it:
* filesUploaded - The total number of files uploaded
* errors - The total number of errors while uploading
* allBytesLoaded - The total number of bytes uploaded
* speed - The average speed of all uploaded files
